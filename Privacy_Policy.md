## Bename: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Bename app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Ethan Temple, and the source code is available on GitHub.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme), people and tags) created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, and `android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` | These permissions are used to detect the location of the user. When the user travels in range of a tagged location within the app, the app will send the user a notification. This permission must be enabled by the user, and is required for the location functionality of the app to work. |
| `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Required by the app to post notifications. Has to be granted by the user manually; can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. It is highly recommended that you allow this permission so that the app can show location notifications.
